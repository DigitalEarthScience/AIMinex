Modifying Color/Shape options
==============================

The Color/Shape modification window can be found under the Edit Menu in the menubar. The Color/Shape modification window is used to edit Colors and Shapes. Within the window, the user can select a column and edit the corresponding shapes associated with each unique element in that column. The same stands for the colour selection except that the column defining the elements is selected at the "Filter by:" Combobox located at the top left of the program (step three in :doc:`Program Tutorial <step_guide>`.).
