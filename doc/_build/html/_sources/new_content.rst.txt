Setting Up Excel Sheet
=================================
To ensure the best performance of the program, the columns of the Excel spreadsheet must be correctly labelled. For instance, the Dillhole column and a column that includes the word "Depth" are required for the Drill Hole Function. Additionally, elements containing concentration values in either _ppm or _pct are mandatory as input data for the program. Other features, such as Lithology and Rock Units, can also be selected to display the colour or shape of data points within the program. An example spreadsheet is shown below:
